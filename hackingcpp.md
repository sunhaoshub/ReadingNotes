# First Steps

## Input&Output(Basics)

std::cout and std::clog should write to buffer first and ten write to console

std::err immediately writes to console

### avoid std::endl

should not use std::endl frequently



# Fundamental Types

C++11 ï¼štype  variable{value};

Variables of  fundamental types are not initialized by default

Because in C++ you only pay for what you use (initilaization of large memory blocks can be quite expensive)
